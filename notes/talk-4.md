## CSS specification updates for March 2016

-  [CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1 (Candidate Recommendation)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-css-flexbox-1-20160301/#changes)
    - describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface design.
    - the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can “flex” their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. 
    - both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated.
    - nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions. 
-  [CSS Round Display Level 1 (Working Draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-round-display-1/#changes)
    - describes CSS extensions to support a round display. The extensions help web authors to build a web page suitable for a round display. 
- [CSSOM (Working Draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-cssom-1-20160317/#change-history)

- [CSSOM View (Working Draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-cssom-view-1-20160317/#change-history)
    - provide authors with a way to inspect and manipulate the visual view of a document. This includes getting the position of element layout boxes, obtaining the width of the viewport through script, and also scrolling an element.
- [CSS Device Adaptation Module Level 1 (Working Draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-css-device-adapt-1-20160329/)

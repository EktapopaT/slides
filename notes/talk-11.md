    + In case you never heard of CSS Scroll Snap, here's a [CSS-tricks introduction post](https://css-tricks.com/introducing-css-scroll-snap-points/)
    + Some minor changes since the working draft:
        + Renamed `scroll-snap-padding` to `scroll-padding` and extended its uses.
        + Removed renaming issues because nobody came up with a better alternative to `scroll-snap-type: mandatory | proximity` or `scroll-snap-stop: normal`.
        + Miscellaneous clarifications.
